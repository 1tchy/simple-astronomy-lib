A simple and free astronomy library for calculating moon phase



A simple (and free) astronomy library for calculating moon phase, solar eclipses, etc. This is intended to be used as a library within other projects, thus the list of dependencies will remain as small as possible.

NOTE: additional contributors welcome

==Current Functionality==
  # Moon Phase - find date for next phase of the moon (full or new)
  # ...

==Getting Started / Example==
For a brief page on how to use this library, read the [http://code.google.com/p/simple-astronomy-lib/wiki/GettingStartedExample Getting Started page].

==Functional Goals== 
(vote for what we should work on next):
  * Sunrise / Sunset
  * Rising and setting of other celestial objects
  * Solar Eclipse - find date of next solar eclipse
  * Lunar Eclipse - find date of next lunar eclipse
  * Find location of sun or moon (right ascension, declination)
  * TBD


==Project Goals==
  * Minimize number of dependencies (useful for mobile device usage)
  * Automated unit test coverage of more than 75% of code
  * Accuracy to within 5 minutes (currently +/-15 minutes)


==Schedule==
  * ~~Initial code commit before April 1, 2011~~ DONE!
  * ~~Decent documentation on usage before June 30, 2011~~
  * ~~Jenkins CI builds configured~~ (still need SVN commit hook)
